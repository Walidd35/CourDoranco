# Practice: data passing with the super global _GET

_Let's create a home page with 3 links to 3 product pages._

Each link will pass down informations:

- bmw : model=> bmw, color => yellow, year => 2018
- mercedes : model=> mercedes, color => blue, year => 2011
- renault : model=> renault, color => black, year => 2022

Style of the product page:

- create a card (div)
- h2 for the model
- p for the color
- p for the release year
