//ABOUT

React Native uses the framework Expo to turn JS into:
    - html and css
    - Android's Java
    - Ios' Swift
giving us abilities to create mobile apps.

//LAUNCH

npx create-expo-app@latest

then go into my-app and
npx expo start

//SETTINGS
Go to app.json

- splash (screen) is the display pending during the app's loading when opening

//FRESH start
npm run reset-project

//TSX Vs JSX
In .tsx, we need to define the type of each props and parameters we use

//IMPORTANT

React Native doesn't accept one lined shorcuts for css rules
React Native doesn't take dimension value as string but as numbers

_layout.tsx allows to create and organize the navigation links and menu
    - you can have layouts inside layouts

//IMAGES:
you can use the React Native tag Image
    - style it with a width and height
    - source={{uri: "url-name"}}

If it's a file in your assets/img folder:
    - style it with a width and height
    - source={require("path")}

//BONUS
the command rfc imports automatically the needed components from React
or rnf

rfc = import react from 'react' with a export default function returning a basic div

rnf
