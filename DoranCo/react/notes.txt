Reacts components can receive only 1 parameter that is an object

The spread operator (...name) allows us to extract all the combos key:value of an object:
    ex:
       const user = {
             email: "samy@email.com",
             password: "azert",
             };

const profile = {
  name: "Djemai",
  prenom: "samy",
};

const bigObject = { ...user, ...profile };
